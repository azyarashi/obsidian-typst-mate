# To users of Obsidian LaTeX Suite

## Comparison with Obsidian LaTeX Suite

Meanings of the symbols:

- ✅: Not needed / already supported
- ⚠️: Partially supported
- ❌: Not supported

### ✅ Auto-fraction

In Typst, typing <kbd>/</kbd> in math mode is treated as a fraction.
If you want the `/` character itself, either escape it or type `slash`.

### ⚠️ Matrix shortcuts

With Script Snippets you can instantly generate a matrix of the desired size.
Combined with this plugin's unique Tabout feature, matrix editing becomes fast.

### ✅ Conceal

Typst accepts Unicode characters directly, so concealment is unnecessary.
Additionally, this plugin provides symbol suggestions & completion.

### ✅ Tabout

Additionally, jumping with the <key>Shift + Tab</key> key is also supported.
See [here](/docs/TabJump.md) for details.

### ✅ Visual snippets

Supports a wider variety of snippet types.
See [here](/docs/Shortcut.md) for details.

### ✅ Auto-enlarge brackets

Typst adjusts bracket sizes automatically.
If you want to customize this, use [Left/Right](https://typst.app/docs/reference/math/lr).

### ✅ Color and highlight matching brackets

Instead of coloring the bracket adjacent to the cursor, this highlights the parent bracket at the cursor's position.
This makes nesting relationships easier to understand.

### ✅ Editor commands

Additionally, this plugin has its own unique commands.
See [here](/docs/Commands.md) for details.

### ✅ Snippets

Custom variables using brackets are available.
Suggestions and completion also work.
